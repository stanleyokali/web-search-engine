This guide walks you through the process of creating a simple search engine link:/understanding/REST[RESTful web service] with Spring.

== What you'll build

You'll build a service that will accept HTTP GET requests at:

----
localhost:8080/search?q=test&size=10&page=1

q: search keywords
size: the number of results to be displayed
page: the current page of the results list
----

and respond with a link:/understanding/JSON[JSON] representation of a greeting:

[source,json]
----
{
    "total": 27,
    "suggestedSearch": "test",
    "hits": [
        {
            "metadata": {
                "title": "All Standards and Drafts - W3C.htm",
                "description": "19"
            }
        },
        {
            "metadata": {
                "title": "The ILU Requestor for HTTP servers.htm",
                "description": "16"
            }
        },
        ...
    ]
}
----

== What you'll need
Go through this tutorial https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/ to build a simple spring boot REST service

Install mvn
----
sudo apt install maven
----
Run the service by using
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----
Alternatively, build the JAR file and then run it
----
./mvnw clean package
java -jar target/search-engine-backend-0.1.0.jar
----
